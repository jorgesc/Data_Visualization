Summary
----------

I have downloaded the Flights dataset, and I want to show how the season
effects the flights delay. I have processed the data to make a much smaller
dataset (The original is about 12Gb). The chart clearly shows the proportion of
delayed minutes on all the monthly flight time. It also shows how the delays
are much higher on summer (probably because much more people are traveiling)
and in winter (because bad weather conditions)


Design
------
I have chosen a bar chart I needed something to show clearly the delayed time
proportions and view how they change as the months go by at a glance

The chart will show a whole year that can be changed using two buttons. The year
range will be 1995-2008, early years dont have completed delay data so I
decided to filter them out.

I have removed the x axis title because is not neccesary, each month have his
name.

I also added an animation so the years will go by automatically. This gives a
better understanding on how the season affect the delays without losing
attention by clicking buttons.

A legend was also added to explain the colors on the chart and to show the bars
details.


Feedback
---------
I show the chart to some friends, two of them said that the text of the axis
was very small so I changed the font to make it more readable on all kind of
monitors.

The other one, said that the buttons were, on an spanish expression, "muy
cutres", and I agreed he was right, so I moved them to another place and
change the style to make them look better.

Also, the Udacity reviewer (sorry, I cannot find your name anywhere) told me a
few improvements to be made, such as interaction and animation, so I added a
play button to make the years go by automatically and also some hovering
functions to inspect in detail each bar.

- Bigger text
- Reshape buttons and year
- Ugly buttons
- Years animation
- Bars interaction
