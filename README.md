Summary
----------

I have downloaded the Flights dataset, and I want to show how the season effects the flights delay. I have processed the data to make a much smaller dataset (The original is about 12Gb). The chart clearly shows the proportion of delayed minutes on all the monthly flight time. It also shows how the delays are much higher on summer (probably because much more people are traveiling) and in winter (because bad weather conditions)


Design
------
I have chosen a bar chart to better show the proportion between total flight hours and of all those total hour, which proportion were delayed the plane. The chart will show a whole year that can be changed using two buttons. The year range will be 1995-2008, early years dont have completed delay data.
I have removed the x axis title because is not neccesary, each month have his name.


Feedback
